    <p>The first vessel built within the limits of the
United States for commercial uses was a sea-going
pinnace of thirty tons named the <i>Virginia</i>.
Her keel was laid at the mouth of the Kennebec
River, in Maine, on an unnamed day in the fall of 1607.
The story of this vessel, though brief, is of great interest
because, in part, of certain peculiarities of rig and hull
which, in connection with a sea-going vessel, now seem
astounding, but chiefly because it portrays something of
the character of the men who, a little later, laid the
foundations of the American Republic.

   <p>Although geographical conditions were in most
respects against them, it is manifest from any
study of the New Englanders that their chief
mercantile interests, during the earliest years, were concentrated
in the fur trade. The Pilgrims devoted their
first surplus crop to that trade, and the first voyage of
Winthrop's <i>Blessing of the Bay</i> was to "eastward." According
to the contracts, they had come to make fishing
stations; yet the large profits made on such furs as they
were able to secure kept their minds fixed on the Indian
trade. But, happily, at an opportune moment a man
came to Salem who was able to see that enduring prosperity
could be found by the colonists only in the fisheries;
and by example as well as precept he speedily led them to
accept his view. Curiously enough, as it must seem in
our modern view of the profession, this man was a clergyman,
the Rev. Hugh Peter (written also Peters).</p>

    <p>Among the first acts of the English Parliament
for the regulation of the commerce of the American
colonies, notable here, was that passed in
1646, by which it was provided that no colonial produce
should be carried away to foreign ports except in vessels
under the British flag.</p>
